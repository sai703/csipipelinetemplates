This is a YAML script defining an Azure DevOps template.

The template has three stages: `Test, Build and Publish, and Funtion App deployment`.

In the `Test` stage, the template runs tests for a .NET application. 

In the `Build and Publish` stage, the template builds and publishes the application. 

The `Funtion App deployment` stage deploys the function app to different environments based on the function_deploy_params parameter.

The `parameters` section defines the input parameters for the template, including `project_file, function_deploy_params, pool, vsts_feed, client_id, client_secret, tenant_id, dev, qa, and veracode_service_connection`.

The template uses `templates` located in the `/application/dotnet/test.yaml`, `/function-app/build.yaml`, `/function-app/deploy.yaml`, and `/function-app/readyApi.yaml` files to perform the specified tasks.

In addition, the script has an added Git Branch Strategy that only runs the `dev` stage if the pipeline is run from the feature branch.

Here is the `stage.yaml` file explained with each parameter:

parameters:

 `project_file`: A parameter of type `object` that represents the list of `projects` to build and publish.

 `function_deploy_params`: A parameter of type `object` that represents the list of environments and their corresponding `Function App` configurations to deploy.

 `pool`: A parameter of type `string` that specifies the name of the `agent pool` to use for the pipeline.

 `vsts_feed`: A parameter of type `string` that specifies the name of the `VSTS feed` to use for the pipeline.

 `client_id`: A parameter of type `string` that represents the Azure Active Directory client ID.

 `client_secret`: A parameter of type `string` that represents the Azure Active Directory client secret.

 `tenant_id`:  A parameter of type `string` that represents the Azure Active Directory tenant ID.

 `dev`: A parameter of type `string` that represents the name of the `dev` environment. 

 `qa`: A parameter of type `string` that represents the name of the `qa` environment.

 `veracode_service_connection`: A parameter of type `string` that represents the name of the Veracode service connection to use for the pipeline.

---

`stage Test`:

Here is the `test.yaml` file explained with each parameter:

`Test`: A stage that represents the application testing stage. It has a job named `Test` that runs all the tests using the `test.yaml` template.

`az_cli_login`: A parameter that specifies whether or not to log in to `Azure CLI` during the pipeline run.

`azure_subscription`: A parameter that represents the name of the `Azure subscription` to use for the pipeline.

`build_configuration`: A parameter that specifies the build configuration to use for the pipeline.

`working_directory`: A parameter that specifies the working directory for the pipeline.

`reports_folder`: A parameter that specifies the folder to store the test results in.

`project_file`: A parameter that specifies the path to the project file(s) to test.

---

`stage Build:`

`$each csproj in parameters.project_file` (iteration over project files):

`job: ${{ replace(replace(split(csproj.artifact_name, '/')[-1], '-', '_'), '.', '_') }}`: A dynamically named job based on the artifact name. This job builds and publishes the specified project.

`steps`: The steps to be executed in the Build and Publish job.

`parameters`: The parameters passed to the `build.yaml` template, including:

`veracode_service_connection`: The name of the `Veracode service connection` to use for scanning the code.

`veracodeAppName`: The name of the `Veracode application` to use for scanning the code.

`project_file`: The path to the project file that contains the `application code`.

`artifact_name`: The name of the artifact to use for `publishing` the application.

`vsts_feed`: This parameter defines the name of the Azure DevOps feed where the built artifacts should be published.

---
`deploy stage`:

`parameters.function_deploy_params`: This is a parameter that is passed into the YAML pipeline. It contains information about the function apps that will be deployed and the environments to which they will be deployed.

`variables['Build.SourceBranch']`: This is a variable that is used to determine the Git branch from which the pipeline is being run.

`env.environment`: This is a variable that contains the name of the environment to which the function app will be deployed.

`env.apps`: This is a list of the function apps that will be deployed to the environment specified in env.environment.

`app.name`: This is the name of the function app being deployed.

`app.artifact_name`: This is the name of the artifact that contains the function app code.

`azure_subscription`: This is a parameter that is passed into the YAML pipeline. It contains information about the Azure subscription to be used for the deployment.

`contains(env.environment, parameters.dev)`: This is a condition that checks if the environment specified in env.environment contains the string specified in parameters.dev.

`replace(replace(split(env.environment, '/')[-1], '-', '_'), '.', '_')`: This is a series of string manipulations that converts the environment name to a format that can be used as a stage name in the pipeline.

`deployment`: This is a keyword that specifies that a deployment task is being performed.

`strategy`: This is a keyword that specifies the deployment strategy to be used.

`runOnce`: This is a deployment strategy that specifies that the deployment task should only be run once.

`template`: This is a keyword that specifies that a template file is being used for the deployment task.

`/function-app/deploy.yaml@application-pipeline-templates`: This is the path to the template file that contains the deployment task for deploying a function app.

`/function-app/readyApi.yaml@application-pipeline-templates`: This is the path to the template file that contains the deployment task for testing the deployed function app using ReadyAPI.

`parameters.artifact_name`: This is a parameter that is passed into the deployment task template. It contains the name of the artifact that contains the function app code.

`parameters.function_app_name`: This is a parameter that is passed into the deployment task template. It contains the name of the function app being deployed.

`parameters.azure_subscription`: This is a parameter that is passed into the deployment task template. It contains information about the Azure subscription to be used for the deployment.

`parameters.environmentName`: This is a parameter that is passed into the ReadyAPI deployment task template. It contains the name of the environment to be used for testing the deployed function app.

`parameters.version`: This is a parameter that is passed into the ReadyAPI deployment task template. It contains the version of the function app to be tested.
